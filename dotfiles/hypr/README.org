* HyprLand Configuration
** Introduction
This is my hyprland configuration it is designed to be minimal and focused more on the efficiency. Hence why most of the things you expect from a HyprDE might not work like themeing on every application. This is merely designed for my personal taste. I don't expect this setup to work on everyone first try.

NOTE: This is simply a preference taste you have to tweak it so that it becomes into a setup you want.

** Philosophy
This is my setup mainly it is just supposed to work. Unlike other setups it is not aimed to make your hyprland setup look nice or have nice animations or features. It is focused around minimalism and simplicity.Thus everything is just supposed to work. Also it is centered around the gruvbox color scheme and it is focused arround a simple window ruling and workflow.
NOTE: Default applications should be changed if you don't have those. 
** Setup
NOTE: This is simply meant to be an explanation section. You have to refer the files to see a whole lot more.
*** Main
In the hyprland.conf file we have refactored a lot of the thing to not have them in one file. Have all of my things into other places.
#+BEGIN_SRC hyprland.conf
exec-once = ~/.config/hypr/scripts/autostart.sh &

source = ~/.config/hypr/modules/monitors.conf
source = ~/.config/hypr/modules/general.conf
source = ~/.config/hypr/modules/input.conf
source = ~/.config/hypr/modules/binds.conf
source = ~/.config/hypr/modules/rules.conf
#+END_SRC
*** Monitors
In the monitor.conf file we specify what monitor we are using
#+BEGIN_SRC hyprland.conf
monitor=eDP-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1.0
#+END_SRC
NOTE: You can add more monitors setting if you have more monitor setting. I personally dont have them so I removed them. Refer the hyprland wiki on how to add more this is a simple use of my setup
*** Input
In the input.conf file we specify what layout and stuff we are using I have not changed the default that comes from the default hyprland setup.

*** General
In the general.conf file I specified what you have to do as a general configuration like gaps, animations and stuff of that nature.

**** Gaps
This is setting up the windows gaps which is in pixel. I have gone to crazy with the gaps but the good thing is I don't usually have splits of applications because I use more of a work space setup meaning applications are bound to certain work spaces more on that later.
#+BEGIN_SRC
gaps_in = 10 
gaps_out = 10
#+END_SRC
**** Borders
This is setting up the border color and size and some basic settings.
#+BEGIN_SRC
border_size = 3
col.active_border = rgba(ffdd33ee)
col.inactive_border = rgba(95a99bee) rgba(565f73ee) 45deg
layout = master
allow_tearing = false
#+END_SRC

**** Bluring
The only reason I have setup bluring is because of firefox UI I custom made which looks cool I am thinking of changing that.
#+BEGIN_SRC
decoration {
    blur {
        enabled = true
        size = 40
    }
}
#+END_SRC
