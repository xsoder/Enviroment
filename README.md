I am trying hyprland for some time with some config.
This is a minimal config if it does not work I can't help you.
## Main tools
1. [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/docs)
2. [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
3. [hyprland](https://wiki.hyprland.org/)
4. [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
## How to use it
1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/tadihailukebe/devenv.git
```
2. Change direcotory
```sh
cd devenv
```
3. Run the script with arguments
This will just install the base packages that I use on daily basis
```sh
bash script install base
```
This will show u all the arguments you are supposed to use
```sh
bash script
```
Have fun and don't submit PR or any contrubution this is how I do my things for dotifiles
